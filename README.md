# ZeroDivisionError in Python
This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError, which occurs when dividing by zero.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a solution.

**Error:**
The `my_function` attempts to divide `a` by `b`. When `b` is 0, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised.

**Solution:**
The solution involves adding a check to prevent division by zero. This check ensures that the program handles the case gracefully, preventing the error.
